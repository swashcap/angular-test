      "content": "<p>Yinka Adegoke, writing for Billboard:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When news broke on Thursday May 8 that Apple was in talks to buy\nJimmy Iovine and Dr Dre’s Beats Electronics for a shocking $3.2\nbillion the deal’s closure seemed imminent. In fact Billboard’s\nsources repeatedly said late that day, the transaction would be\nannounced the following Monday… “Tuesday, latest.”</p>\n\n<p>Well, Monday and Tuesday passed and we were assured the deal would\nactually be announced early this week. By early this week we were\ntold it would now be announced next week. We, like other outlets,\nhave been reassured the deal is happening…or as close to\ndefinitely happening as any source is willing to say given they’re\nspeaking on background.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That they&#8217;ve been so wrong thus far makes me disinclined to believe anything Billboard (or <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/e330e830-d6f3-11e3-b95e-00144feabdc0.html?siteedition=intl#slide0\">The Financial Times</a>, or <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304431104579550392146532138\">The Wall Street Journal</a>, or anyone else who reported the deal as imminent back on May 8) reports about it now.</p>\n\n<p>Among the reasons Adegoke cites for the delay:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apparently, the Apple family near imploded with outrage when that\nvideo went up on Facebook of an ‘excited’ Dr. Dre with R&amp;B\nsinger/former Coca Cola pin-up Tyrese. In the video they share, in\nlanguage perhaps unsuitable for a family blog, how Dre will be\nhip-hop’s first billionaire and other nice things about Compton.\nPeople often forget that despite Apple being this company that\nmakes sexy products, with sexy profit margins, and sexy retail\noutlets… it is not in fact a very sexy company. It is a\nconservative company, particularly without the leadership of its\nguiding light Steve Jobs who would shake things up massively on a\ndaily basis.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Steve Jobs did not &#8220;shake things up massively on a daily basis&#8221;, and my guess is, he would have been <em>more pissed off than anyone</em> at Apple about Beats&#8217; leaking of the deal to the press. And it seems pretty clear that that&#8217;s what happened. It wasn&#8217;t Apple that leaked, it was Beats, and their leaking it might have scuttled the deal.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One thing’s for sure: Apple is suffering a crisis of confidence\nright now and they could do with a pair who help them to “Think\nDifferent”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Anyone who thinks &#8220;Apple is suffering a crisis of confidence right now&#8221; doesn&#8217;t understand Apple at all. No wonder Billboard has botched the story on this acquisition.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘About That Apple-Beats Deal’\"  href=\"http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/05/23/apple-beats-billboard\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n  "
