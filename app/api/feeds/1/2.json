Fortunately, the local grocery store had a Dragon’s\nLair cabinet, as well as a couple of other games, so I got many\noccasions to practice.</p>\n\n<p>One day I was sitting in our apartment reading a video game\nmagazine (nerd!), and in the back was a little section of\nclassified ads. My eye was caught immediately by the words “Beat\nSpace Ace and Dragon’s Lair!” For a few bucks, you could send away\nfor this random guy’s strategy guide, which listed all the moves\nand when to make them.</p>\n\n<p>Please realize there was no residential internet. We had a\ncomputer, but no modem. There was no just going to Google for an\nFAQ or walkthrough. If you didn’t know the moves, you just didn’t\nknow them, unless you knew someone else who knew them, which of\ncourse you didn’t.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What a great story.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Arcade Story’\"  href=\"http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/05/21/stevenf-arcade-story\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>"

      "content": "<p>Timothy B. Lee, writing for Vox, says the Surface Pro 3 shows that Microsoft &#8220;doesn&#8217;t get the tablet revolution&#8221;:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>But this makes as much sense as selling a digital camera that also\ntakes film photographs. Anyone who needs the power of a PC can and\nshould just buy a PC. The point of buying a tablet is that it&#8217;s\ncheaper, smaller, lighter, simpler, and more power-efficient than\na traditional PC. Those advantages are only possible because\ntablets don&#8217;t try to be all things to all people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll take the devil&#8217;s advocate position here. I think Microsoft now fully understands what the iPad is and why it&#8217;s popular. What they&#8217;re saying with the Surface Pro 3 is that the tablet form factor isn&#8217;t necessarily only for iPad-style devices, but that it&#8217;s a good form factor for full-featured PCs as well.</p>\n\n<p>This isn&#8217;t new to the Surface Pro <em>3</em> in particular &#8212; it&#8217;s been the point behind the Surface Pro all along. As <a href=\"https://twitter.com/harrymccracken/statuses/468780783067758592\">Harry McCracken noted on Twitter</a>, &#8220;Surface Pro 3 seems less like an iPad-era tablet, more like the Tablet PC which Microsoft couldn&#8217;t design in 2000.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>In other words, Microsoft&#8217;s point is less about Windows 8 vs. iOS, and more about the tablet vs. laptop form factor for full-featured PC users.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Just What Are &#8216;Tablets&#8217;?’\"  href=\"http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/05/21/what-are-tablets\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>"
