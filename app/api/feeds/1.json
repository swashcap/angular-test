Wait till\nAmazon controls the whole market &#8212; then see how well it treats\nauthors, publishers and customers.</p>\n\n<p>Now Amazon is walking right into its detractors’ predictions.\nThere are a couple obvious reasons this is a bad strategy. It’s\nbad public relations &#8212; if it doesn’t already, Amazon may soon\ncontrol a monopolistic stake of the e-book market and its tactics\nare sure to invite not only scorn from the book industry but also\nincreased regulatory oversight.</p>\n\n<p>But the more basic problem here is that Amazon is violating its\nown code. To win a corporate battle, Amazon is ruining its\ncustomer experience. Mr. Bezos has long pointed to customer\nsatisfaction as his North Star; making sure customers are treated\nwell is the guiding principle for how he runs Amazon.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Farhad Manjoo: &#8216;Amazon&#8217;s Tactics Confirm Its Critics&#8217; Worst Suspicions&#8217;’\"  href=\"http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/05/26/manjoo-amazon\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>"

Can you tell what’s wrong with it?</p>\n\n<p>The awkward array of five logos used to be a tidy lineup of six.\nThe day before the show, Apple removed McGraw-Hill, the\n122-year-old publisher whose 61-year-old leader, Harold McGraw III\n&#8212; better known as Terry &#8212; <a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2010/01/26/mcgraw-hill-tablet/\">prattled like a teenage schoolgirl</a>\nabout the tablet’s iPhone operating system on CNBC:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Yes, they’ll make their announcement tomorrow on this one. We have\nworked with Apple for quite a while. And the Tablet is going to be\nbased on the iPhone operating system and so it will be\ntransferable. So what you are going to be able to do now is we\nhave a consortium of e-books. And we have 95% of all our materials\nthat are in e-book format on that one. So now with the tablet\nyou’re going to open up the higher education market, the\nprofessional market. The tablet is going to be just really\nterrific.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The first rule of making a deal with Apple is that you do not talk about making a deal with Apple. Take a guess what the second rule is.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘2010: McGraw-Hill Axed From iPad Launch After CEO Leaks on TV’\"  href=\"http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/05/23/mcgraw\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>"

At this point, I’m at wits end\ntrying to figure out why our high-quality site, featuring good\nadvice from a dedicated community of real people with a\nbest-in-industry 24-hour moderation staff has seen such big\ndecreases.</p>\n\n<p>On the flip side, I’ll accept that MetaFilter is from “<a href=\"http://www.theawl.com/2014/05/the-new-internet-gods-have-no-mercy\">two or\nthree Internets ago</a>”, and perhaps this is Google’s way of\nsaying they’re changing with the times and we’re not. I’m ok with\nthat too, but since Google is a giant black box to outsiders,\nwe’ll never really know.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Depressing news.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.marco.org/2014/05/22/future-of-metafilter\">Says Marco Arment</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Google <em>owns</em> the ad-driven web: their search brings all of your\npageviews, and their ads bring all of your income. You’re just\nalong for the ride, hoping to stay in Google’s good graces &#8212; an\narbitrary, unreliable, undocumented metric that changes\nconstantly. (Google’s only “open” with the trivial, unprofitable\nparts of their business. Search and ads are closed, proprietary,\nand opaque in every possible way.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is one reason I&#8217;ve never tried to monetize pageviews at Daring Fireball. My goal has always been to increase <em>readers</em> &#8212; to reach and appeal to people who want to come here to read what I write, on a daily or at least regular basis. I get thousands of referrals every day from Google, but I don&#8217;t try to monetize them. My only hope is for a few of them to like what they see and come back.</p>\n\n<p>I think I can keep writing stuff that people want to read. I don&#8217;t know how to write stuff that Google&#8217;s ever-changing algorithms will return as highly-placed search results, so I&#8217;ve never really tried.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘On the Future of MetaFilter’\"  href=\"http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/05/23/haughey-metafilter\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>"

Perhaps being illegally discriminate too. The food is\nirrelevant as the service is less than poor.&#8221; The reviewer lives\nin Phoenix.

It&#8217;s Google&#8217;s favoritism for Google Plus.

Under normal circumstances, this would not\npose as a problem. However, the published blurb provided\nadvanced information on Apple hardware products to be announced\nat the expo.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;ATI plans a surprise announcement on July 19,&#8221; the messages\nstated, in part. &#8220;In a keynote, wait for Apple to announce three\nnew systems with ATI graphics in them. One will be an iMac with\nthe RAGE 4XL chip, the remaining two are PowerMacs which will ship\nwith RAGE 128 PRO standard and RADEON.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>This blurb was apparently enough to send Apple cofounder and CEO,\nSteve Jobs, through the roof. As a result, source said, Mr. Jobs\nripped all mention of ATI and their products from his keynote\npresentation this morning. Apple&#8217;s introduction of new Power Mac\nG4 systems went without mention of the graphics chip that would\nship inside, and the same was the case for the company&#8217;s new iMacs\nand Power Mac G4 Cube.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.insidemacgames.com/news/story.php?ArticleID=370\">InsideMacGames, on the same day</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Well, that rumor cost ATI, big time! When the Bizwire report on\nMacworld Expo Exhibitors surfaced, dozens of news outlets\n(including IMG) reported ATI&#8217;s plans for the Expo. However, that\nshort summary gave away several key secrets from the Keynote -\nspecifically, it hinted at the two new PowerMacs (the MP models)\nand the new iMac DV SE revision, and Steve Jobs was extremely\nupset at this. He likes surprises.</p>\n\n<p>According to ATI, Steve ordered all Radeons to be pulled from the\nshow floor, and wiped all mention of ATI out of his keynote\nspeech. He also canceled part of the keynote where an ATI exec was\nsupposed to speak, and demo the Radeon! It seems no one leaks\nSteve&#8217;s secrets without dire penalty. It wasn&#8217;t clear who was at\nfault for the leak, but it seems to have come from the ATI side.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(Thanks to DF reader <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JeffCGD/status/469960922895630336\">Jeff Clatworthy</a> for the reminder about this incident.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Regarding Steve Jobs and the Leaking of Deals Before Apple Is Ready to Announce Them’\"  href=\"http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/05/23/ati\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>"
